# Screen Flows & Page Architecture

> **Document:** `UserFlows.md` | **Version:** 4.0 | **Last Updated:** June 2026  
> **Status:** ✅ Active | **Owner:** Frontend Lead | **Review Cadence:** Quarterly  
> **Total Screens Documented:** 19 | **Total Routes:** 26 (19 pages + 7 API routes)

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the complete screen architecture for the portfolio platform, covering all 19 screens across public, admin, and system categories. Each screen specification includes purpose, inputs, outputs, navigation topology, and all four UI states (loading, error, empty, success). Routes follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions with ISR for public pages and SSR for admin pages.

**Key Metrics:**
- Public screens: 11 | Admin screens: 6 | System screens: 2
- Route patterns: 19 | API patterns: 7 | Layouts: 3 (Public, Admin, Auth)
- Screen states documented: 76 (4 states × 19 screens)
- Navigation flows: 42 documented transitions
- Data dependencies: 17 unique data sources

## Decision Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Date | Approver |
|----|----------|-----------|------------------------|------|----------|
| SF-001 | 19 screens across 3 categories (public, admin, system) over flat page list | Categories group screens by authentication and layout requirements; enables shared layout components (PublicLayout, AdminShell, AuthLayout) and route guard middleware | Flat page list (no layout inheritance, repeated auth logic), feature-based grouping (cross-cutting concerns like auth span features) | 2026-06-01 | Product Owner |
| SF-002 | Next.js App Router with ISR for public pages, SSR for admin, SSG for static content | ISR balances freshness (60s revalidation) with performance (static delivery); SSR ensures admin always sees current data; SSG for legal/privacy pages that rarely change | All SSR (slower public pages), all ISR (admin pages stale), all SSG (no dynamic data) | 2026-06-01 | Product Owner |
| SF-003 | 4-state taxonomy (loading, error, empty, success) for every screen | Consistent state handling across all 19 screens ensures no unhandled edge cases; enables reusable state component patterns (SkeletonLoading, ErrorFallback, EmptyState) | 3 states (missing empty — lead to blank screens), 5 states (adding maintenance — overengineering), 2 states (loading + success — missing error/empty) | 2026-06-01 | Product Owner |
| SF-004 | 3 layouts (Public, Admin, Auth) over unique layout per screen | Shared layouts reduce code duplication, ensure consistent navigation structure, and enable layout-level error boundaries and loading states | Per-screen layout (duplicated navbar/footer code), single layout for all (cannot differentiate admin from public), no layout (every page defines its own structure) | 2026-06-01 | Product Owner |
| SF-005 | 42 documented navigation transitions over implicit or inferred flows | Explicit documentation of every navigation path enables complete test coverage (Playwright smoke tests for each transition), accurate dependency tracking, and thorough error handling | Implicit flows (missed edge cases, gaps in testing), inferred from code (no documentation, onboarding friction) | 2026-06-01 | Product Owner |

## Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|------------|--------|------------|
| SF-R01 | New screen added without updating screen map or state specifications | Medium | Medium | Screen map is referenced in CI via documentation test; PR template requires screen flow update for new routes |
| SF-R02 | State implementations drift from documented 4-state taxonomy | Medium | Medium | Component library enforces state patterns at the atom/molecule level; code review checklist includes state verification |
| SF-R03 | Navigation transitions break when routes are restructured | Low | High | All 42 transitions are covered by Playwright E2E tests; route changes require updating test selectors |
| SF-R04 | Screen specifications become outdated as features evolve | Medium | Low | Quarterly review cadence; screen flows are updated as part of feature implementation (not a separate activity) |
| SF-R05 | Mobile wireframes for responsive screens are missing or inaccurate | Medium | Medium | Responsive designs are spec'd in the screen definition (not a separate document); mobile-first design principle ensures mobile is designed first |

| Direction | Target | Trigger | Animation |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Inbound | Any broken URL | Catch-all route match | Instant render |
| Outbound | `/` | "Go Home" button | Fade to home |
| Outbound | Suggested page | Suggestion link click | Normal navigation |
| Outbound | `/contact` | "Report broken link" | Slide up |

#### States

| State | Trigger | UI | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----|----------|
| **Loading** | — | Not applicable (static page, no async data) | Page is fully static HTML; no loading state needed |
| **Error** | — | Not applicable (this IS the error page) | N/A |
| **Empty** | No similar pages found | Standard 404: large "404" in brand font + "Page not found" + "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved" + "Go Home" button + "Search site" input with autocomplete | Search input queries blog/projects/case studies for suggestions; autocomplete shows up to 5 matches |
| **Success** | Page rendered with suggestions | "404" creative illustration (interactive animation: floating elements or particle "4"s) + "Page not found" text + "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved" + Search bar (with autocomplete dropdown from valid routes) + "Did you mean?" suggestions (up to 3 close-matching routes) + Quick links: Home, Projects, Blog, Contact + "Report broken link" link → admin notification if visited by authenticated admin | Suggestions are generated by fuzzy-matching the invalid pathname against the sitemap; search autocomplete indexes all public pages; 404 event logged to PostHog for broken link monitoring |

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ISR** | Incremental Static Regeneration — Next.js feature that re-renders static pages at runtime after the initial build; used for public pages to balance freshness (60s revalidation) with performance |
| **SSR** | Server-Side Rendering — pages rendered per-request on the server; used for admin dashboard pages to ensure current data is always displayed |
| **SSG** | Static Site Generation — pages pre-built at build time; used for legal/privacy pages that rarely change |
| **Screen Map** | Topology diagram showing all application screens, their routes, navigation transitions, and layout hierarchy; the authoritative source for page routing |
| **4-State Taxonomy** | Every screen must handle four states: loading (skeleton), error (fallback with retry), empty (helpful message + call to action), and success (populated content) |
| **Navigation Transition** | A directed path from one screen to another triggered by user action (click, form submit) or system event (redirect after login); 42 documented in total |
| **Layout Shell** | Outer layout component shared across multiple screens: PublicLayout (Navbar + Footer), AdminShell (Sidebar + Header + Content), AuthLayout (minimal, centered form) |
| **Route Group** | Next.js App Router convention for organizing routes without affecting URL; `(public)`, `(admin)`, `(auth)` groups with their respective layouts |
| **Wireframe** | Low-fidelity screen layout specifying content regions, component placement, and responsive breakpoints before implementation |
| **Component Tree** | Hierarchical diagram showing which components compose each screen, their parent-child relationships, and data flow between them |
| **Responsive Screen** | Screen whose layout adapts across breakpoints (mobile <768px, tablet 768-1024px, desktop >1024px) with potentially different component arrangements per breakpoint |
| **Data Dependency** | External data source (API endpoint, database table, service) that a screen depends on to render; tracked per-screen in the screen specification |
| **Skeleton Loading** | Placeholder UI that mimics the final page layout during data fetching — prevents layout shift (CLS = 0) and provides perceived performance |
| **Error Fallback** | UI state displayed when a data dependency fails — includes error message, retry button, and optional navigation alternatives |
| **Empty State** | UI state when a data dependency returns successfully but with zero results — provides helpful guidance instead of blank content |
