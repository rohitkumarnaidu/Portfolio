# 🌐 Agent Networking — Inter-Agent Communication Mesh

> **Document:** `AGENT-NETWORKING.md` | **Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** July 2026  
> **Status:** ✅ Active | **Owner:** Principal AI Architect | **Review Cadence:** Quarterly  
> **Related:** [AgentMarketplace.md](./AgentMarketplace.md) | [Agent.md](./Agent.md) | [18-AGENTS.md](./18-AGENTS.md) | [Agent-Interaction-Protocol.md](./Agent-Interaction-Protocol.md)

## Executive Summary

The Agent Networking layer provides a resilient, low-latency communication mesh for agent-to-agent and agent-to-service interactions across the enterprise. Built on WebSocket, SSE, and a lightweight service mesh, it supports synchronous RPC, asynchronous event streaming, and broadcast messaging with automatic discovery, circuit breaking, and configurable timeout/retry policies. Every message is authenticated, traced, and observable through the platform's existing Sentry and Datadog pipelines.

## 1. Communication Topology

### 1.1 Mesh Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Agent Mesh"
        S1[Supervisor Agent] <-->|WebSocket| R1[Registry Agent]
        S1 <-->|WebSocket| R2[Research Agent]
        S1 <-->|SSE| R3[Monitor Agent]
        R1 <-->|gRPC| DB[(Knowledge Base)]
        R2 <-->|HTTP| API[NestJS API]
        R3 <-->|Event Stream| Q[Message Queue]
    end

    subgraph "External Services"
        API --> EXT[External APIs]
        Q --> W[Webhook Workers]
    end

    subgraph "Observability"
        S1 -->|Trace| SENTRY[Sentry]
        R1 -->|Metrics| DD[Datadog]
    end
```

### 1.2 Transport Protocols

| Protocol | Use Case | Latency | Reliability | Persistence |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **WebSocket** | Bidirectional agent-to-agent commands | < 5ms | Automatic reconnect | Session-scoped |
| **SSE** | Server-to-agent event streams | < 10ms | Last-event-id replay | None |
| **gRPC** | Agent-to-service high-throughput calls | < 2ms | Deadline propagation | None |
| **HTTP/2** | Agent-to-service REST interactions | < 20ms | Idempotency retry | Stateless |
| **Message Queue** | Durable async event dispatch | < 50ms | At-least-once delivery | Durable |

---

## 2. Agent Discovery

### 2.1 Registry-Based Discovery

Agents register with the mesh at startup and are discoverable via the Agent Registry:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | string | Unique agent identifier |
| `capabilities` | string[] | Declared agent capabilities |
| `endpoint` | string | WS/gRPC endpoint URI |
| `health` | string | Health check URL |
| `ttl_seconds` | int | Registration TTL (must refresh) |

### 2.2 Discovery Flow

```
Agent A Starts → Register with Registry → Heartbeat (every 30s)
Agent B Queries → "find agents with capability:X"
Registry Returns → [Agent A endpoint, Agent C endpoint]
Agent B Connects → WebSocket handshake to Agent A
```

## 3. Message Routing

### 3.1 Routing Table

| Message Type | Source | Destination | Transport | Priority |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `command.execute` | Supervisor | Specialist | WebSocket | High |
| `query.knowledge` | Any Agent | Knowledge Service | gRPC | Medium |
| `event.published` | Any Agent | All Subscribers | SSE | Low |
| `heartbeat` | Any Agent | Registry | HTTP | Low |

### 3.2 Routing Rules

1. **Capability-based:** Messages are routed to agents that declare the required capability
2. **Topic-based:** Event subscriptions use pub/sub topics with wildcard support (`knowledge.*`)
3. **Priority queuing:** High-priority messages preempt low-priority in the mesh buffer
4. **Locality preference:** Co-located agents communicate via in-process bus before falling back to network

---

## 4. Timeout and Retry Policies

### 4.1 Default Configuration

| Operation Type | Timeout | Retries | Backoff | Jitter |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| Command execution | 30s | 3 | Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s) | ±100ms |
| Knowledge query | 5s | 2 | Linear (500ms) | ±50ms |
| Event publish | 2s | 0 | None | None |
| Health check | 3s | 1 | Fixed (1s) | None |

### 4.2 Circuit Breaker States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failures > threshold (5 in 60s)
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout (30s)
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Probe succeeds
    HalfOpen --> Open: Probe fails
```

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Closed** | Normal operation; all requests pass |
| **Open** | Requests fail fast without attempting connection |
| **Half-Open** | Limited probe requests to test recovery |

---

## 5. Security and Observability

### 5.1 Transport Security

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Authentication | JWT per-agent tokens with mTLS |
| Encryption | TLS 1.3 for all transports |
| Authorization | Capability-based access control per message type |
| Audit | Every message logged to audit trail with correlation ID |

### 5.2 Observability

Every network hop emits:
- **Trace span** (via Sentry distributed tracing)
- **Metric** (message latency, throughput, error rate)
- **Structured log** (source, destination, message type, duration, status)
